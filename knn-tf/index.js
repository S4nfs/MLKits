/*
Technique - Regression 
Features -  longtitude/latitudes
labels - House price
Algorithm used - K-Nearest Neighbour (knn) "Birds of a feather flock together"

knn with one Intependent variable:
-Find distance between features (longtitude/latitudes of existing houses) and prediction points (longtitude/latitudes of new house)
Distance =  âˆš(lat - lot)2 + (long - long)2
-Sort from lowest to greatest
-Look at the 'k' top records
-Average the label value of those top K records
